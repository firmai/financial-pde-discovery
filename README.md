# Financial PDE Discovery using Machine Learning

This first ever attempt to research the ability to uncover financial PDEs using machine learning tools. 


1. Can the Black-Scholes be rediscovered solely from time series data. 
1. There are various wasy to go about discovering dynamical systems using data-driven discovery.
  1. Equation Free Modelling
  1. Artificial Neural Networks
  1. Nonlinear Regressions
  1. Emperical Dynamical Modelling
  1. Normal Form Identification
  1. Nonlinear Laplacian Spectral Analysis
  1. Modelling Emergent Behaviour and
  1. Automated Inference of Dynamics.
